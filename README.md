Change -> Transmute

## About

Wizards, they're just like us. Armed with the ability to transform objects into other objects, you're presented with a series of needs that you must satisfy. Your transmutation skills (and the ability to walk) are enough to provide for every desire.

## Controls

	R to restart level

In normal mode:

	Arrow keys to move

	SPACE to enter MAGIC MODE

In magic mode:

	Arrow keys to cast magic

	Space to exit MAGIC MODE

## Magic

Your one and only spell is capable of transforming one object into another. You're limited, however, by objects that are in your immediate line of sight along the cardinal directions.
